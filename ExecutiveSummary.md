#Executive summary 

###Problem

When using external sources for coding, there can be many potential issues. Though, the benefits might outweigh these issues, so we need to explore the use of external code to make sure it is right for our company. Instead of developing code in-house, we can outsource to external code to save money and time. However, external code can contain vulnerabilities and need to be maintained for the sake of safety and risk management.

###Solution

Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology Common Platform Enumeration database, our developers can send their files and packages in to get the CPE information. Using the CPE information that is returned, risk can be interpreted and anticipated when using the files and packages. Using this information about the vulnerabilities of the code, the company can work around these vulnerabilities by finding different code or fixing the vulnerabilities if possible.
